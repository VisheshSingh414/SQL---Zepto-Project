# SQL – Zepto Case Study Project

This repository contains a SQL-based case study on Zepto, focused on database schema design and ER modeling for a large-scale e-commerce platform.
The project demonstrates how well-structured relational databases are critical for ensuring data integrity, scalability, and efficient querying in real-world business systems.

# 📌 Project Overview

Zepto operates in a high-volume, fast-paced commerce environment, where efficient data modeling is essential.
This case study explores how Zepto’s backend data could be structured using relational database principles to support core operations such as inventory management, product listing, and order tracking.

The project emphasizes:

- Translating business requirements into database design

- Identifying key entities and their relationships

- Visualizing the schema using an Entity Relationship (ER) Diagram

# 🎯 Objectives

Design a robust relational database schema for an e-commerce platform

Understand how schema design impacts performance and scalability

Apply normalization techniques to reduce redundancy

Build a clear and logical ER diagram

Strengthen practical SQL and database design skills

# 🧱 Database Schema Design

The schema was designed using best practices in relational modeling, ensuring clarity, efficiency, and future scalability.

Key Design Principles Used:

Proper primary and foreign key relationships

Logical entity separation

Normalized tables to avoid data duplication

Support for real-world queries and analytics

# 📊 ER Diagram

An Entity Relationship (ER) Diagram was created to visually represent the database structure.

The ER diagram highlights:

Core entities involved in the Zepto platform

Attributes of each entity

Relationships (One-to-One, One-to-Many)

Data flow across the system
